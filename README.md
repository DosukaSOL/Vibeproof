## 🎯 What is VibeProof?

**VibeProof** is a **proof-of-action gaming platform** built for the **Solana Seeker phone** dApp store that turns real-world actions into digital rewards on Solana.

Available exclusively on Solana Seeker, VibeProof users:
- **Connect their Solana wallet** (via Seeker)
- **Complete verified missions** (follow, post, join, verify)
- **Earn real XP and climb the leaderboard**
- **Build an on-chain reputation**

Think of it as: **LinkedIn meets gaming, powered by Solana—built for Seeker phone users.**

---

## 🚀 The Vision

**Problem:** Digital platforms reward attention, not action. Social tokens and Web3 apps have no standardized way to verify that users actually did something.

**Solution:** VibeProof becomes the **proof-of-action layer** for Solana. Every mission completed is a verified action. Every XP earned is real. Every person on the leaderboard proved they showed up.
